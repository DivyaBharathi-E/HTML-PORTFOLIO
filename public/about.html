<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently pursuing my third year of Computer Communication Engineering at VSB Engineering College, Karur.
   My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in both computer science and communication technologies.
    I have developed a solid understanding of core subjects such as data structures, computer networks, digital communication, and programming languages including C, Python, and Java. 
    This foundation allows me to approach technical challenges with both analytical and practical problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>Throughout my studies, I have worked on several academic projects and lab experiments that have strengthened my technical abilities and teamwork. 
  I am particularly interested in areas like network security, IoT, and embedded systems,
   and I actively explore these topics through online courses and hands-on practice.
    I am also comfortable using software tools such as MATLAB, Packet Tracer, and Arduino IDE, which aid in simulation and prototyping.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical skills, I possess good communication, time management, and leadership abilities,
   which I have demonstrated through group assignments and college events. I am eager to learn new technologies and continuously improve myself to keep up with industry standards.
    With a proactive mindset and a passion for innovation, I am looking forward to contributing effectively in a professional environment.</p>
